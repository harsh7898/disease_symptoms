# Disease Symptoms
Accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease recognition, patient care, and community services as a result of big data advancements in the biomedical and healthcare communities. The accuracy of the study is lowered when the medical data is of poor quality. Additionally, different regions show distinct manifestations of some regional diseases, which may make it harder to predict when outbreaks will occur. This project used hospital data to develop a machine learning decision tree map, Navie Bayes, and random forest algorithm.
