Due to big data progress in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate study of medical data benefits early disease recognition, patient care and community services. When the quality of medical data is incomplete the exactness of study is reduced. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique appearances of certain regional diseases, which may results in weakening the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this project, it bid a Machine learning Decision tree map, Navie Bayes, Random forest algorithm by using structured and unstructured data from hospital. It also uses Machine learning algorithm for partitioning the data. To the highest of gen, none of the current work attentive on together data types in the zone of remedial big data analytics. Compared to several typical calculating algorithms, the scheming accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8% with an regular speed which is quicker than that of the unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm and produces report.
